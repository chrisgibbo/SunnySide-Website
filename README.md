# Sunny_Side_Website ❤️
Frontend Mentor - SunnySide Web Page 💪

### Created via the Frontend Mentor Website Challenge.
This would be the 2nd challenge using Tailwind, perks of using Tailwind is the obvious, using less code in css.


This is a solution to the [Sunnyside agency landing page challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/sunnyside-agency-landing-page-7yVs3B6ef).

### Built with 👇

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Tailwind CSS
- Flexbox
- Responsive Design, coded to example images by platform
- No access to figma files, coded by eye only

### What I learned 👀 
Although this is the second attempt of using Tailwind in a challenge, I've learnt majority of Tailwind via Scrimba. The Tailwind docs helped ALOT, and 
what I learnt was to manage the docs a lot better than when i first started Tailwind. 

I learned that for me, Grid was not something I was able to grasp, at least not yet, so I progressed with Flexbox, and the Tailwind responsiveness design.
